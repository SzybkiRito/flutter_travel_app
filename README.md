<h4 align="center">Mobile app to create ideal plan for your trip</h4>
<h5 align="center">This Flutter application is designed to help users plan and manage their trips. It leverages various technologies and packages to provide a seamless experience for trip planning and management.</h5>

## Technologies and Packages Used

- **Rest API:** We utilize Rest API to fetch and exchange data with external services, enhancing the app's functionality and access to information.

- **Bloc:** The Bloc pattern is employed to manage the app's state, making it easier to handle complex user interactions and data flow.

- **Sqflite:** Sqflite is used as a local database solution, allowing users to store and retrieve trip-related data on their device for offline access.

- **Firebase:** Firebase services are integrated for user authentication.
